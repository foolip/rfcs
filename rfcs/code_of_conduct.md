# RFC #54: Code of Conduct

## Summary

Introduce a code of conduct which clearly defines the acceptable behavior for
all participants in the WPT project and includes contact information for a
group of individuals who can be trusted to enforce the policy.

Publishing a code of conduct is a way "to be overt in our openness, welcoming
all people to contribute, and pledging in return to value them as whole human
beings and to foster an atmosphere of kindness, cooperation, and
understanding." (via
[contributor-covenant.org](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/))

## Details

This RFC consists of two parts: ratifying the content in the [proposed
`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/7520)
file, and setting down guidelines for the moderation team (which exist within
this RFC). Accepting this RFC into WPT means accepting both of these.

Note that the content below are explicitly guidelines for, not requirements on,
the moderation team. That said, consistent violation of these guidelines would
either be a reason to amend this RFC to correct the guidelines, or a reason for
the WPT Core Team to intercede in moderation.

### The Moderation Team

The members of the moderation team will be listed in the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
file. There is no specified size or make-up of the team, but we aim to have a
moderation team which is able to - in most cases - keep itself accountable.
This implies having multiple independent members.

### Handling Incidents/Complaints

The actual actions taken when handling a violation are documented in the
'Moderation' section of the [proposed Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/7520), however this
section lays out some related guidelines.

When handling an incident or complaint, moderators should:

* Respond as promptly as possible to reports of violations.
* When enforcing a moderation decision, notify the person who has been moderated explaining: what rule was violated, what action has been taken, and what to expect next.
* Recuse themselves or be excused from handling an incident if they have any conflict of interests.
* Keep each other accountable.

## Risks

The burden of moderation is not to be taken lightly. If a volunteer is unable
to perform this service, then they will undermine the trust of the people the
code is intended to help. We need to be certain that everyone who volunteers is
prepared to enforce.
