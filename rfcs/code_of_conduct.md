## RFC #17: Code of Conduct

### Summary

Introduce a code of conduct which clearly defines the acceptable behavior for
all participants in the WPT project and includes contact information for a
group of individuals who can be trusted to enforce the policy.

### Details

Publishing a code of conduct is a way "to be overt in our openness, welcoming
all people to contribute, and pledging in return to value them as whole human
beings and to foster an atmosphere of kindness, cooperation, and
understanding." (via
[contributor-covenant.org](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)

### Risks

The burden of enforcement is not to be taken lightly. If a volunteer is unable
to perform this service, then they will undermine the trust of the people the
code is intended to help. We need to be certain that everyone who volunteers is
prepared to enforce.
